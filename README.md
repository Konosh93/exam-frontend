...you are welcome to add any featrues that you may find interesting! 
​
## Steps to deliver the exercise
* Clone this repository.
* Create a new branch.
  * We'll leave the name of the branch to you.
* Create a Pull Request on Github with `<WIP>` as prefix in title.
* When you finish creating the app, please remove `<WIP>` and let us know.
​
​
## Other rules
* Please use TypeScript and React to create the app.
* Please create app using functional components as much as possible.
  * If you decide to use class components, prepare to let us know the reason.
* You do not need to set up storage.
  * It means that if the user reloads the web, it is okay to flush the items.
* If you do not finish all the tasks it is still ok.
  * The purpose of this test is to have conversation about how you code and think when building an app.
  * **Your thinking process is more important** than finishing exam.
